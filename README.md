# 🌀 Andersseen Portfolio — Angular 19 + Tailwind CSS v4 + Three.js

> A bold, experimental portfolio built with the latest Angular features, custom UI ideas, and immersive transitions.

This project is a **design playground** where I combine:

- ⚡️ Angular 19 standalone APIs
- 🎨 Tailwind CSS v4
- 🌌 Three.js for 3D visuals
- 🪄 View Transition API for buttery-smooth navigation
- 🧠 and a bunch of crazy UI/UX concepts inspired by motion, friction, and real-world feedback
